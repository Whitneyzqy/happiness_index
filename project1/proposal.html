            <p>
                Along with the development of society, people now pay more attention to their quality of life.
                Generally, their levels of satisfaction can be reflected with happiness scores, which may be related to
                various factors such as economy, health, or other social factors. Our group selected the data of
                happiness indexes from different regions based on the World Happiness Report.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem we are trying to solve is to figure out the correlation between economics, health, trust in
                government, level of freedom and their happiness indices within different countries from 2015 to 2019.
                Through analyzing these datasets, we will provide users who want to immigrate or travel to another
                country with statistical data and visualizations. These visualizations will provide objective
                information to help them make decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, US News set up a website called “Best Countries for Immigrants” to provide information for
                the user. They have a large set of statistical datasets, but no visualizations or relevant data analysis
                is involved. Thus the goal of this project is to analyze and visualize these datasets to provide a more
                direct insight for the users.

                <h2>App Description</h2>
            </header>
            
            <h3>Who are the users?</h3>
            <p>
                Users of this web application can be the researchers or government workers 
                who study how happiness may be affected by other social factors, or immigrants 
                who want to know about the country they move to. With the filtered data, they 
                can browse on some specific relationships between happiness and each component. 
            </p>
    
            <h3>What can users see?</h3>
            <p>
                The user will be able to see the dataset containing research data of happiness 
                index on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness"><em>Kaggle</em></a>, 
                and economics of different countries on 
                <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/country"><em>World Bank Dsata</em></a>. 
                In addition to the raw data, we will provide users with visualizations to understand 
                the data more directly.
            </p>
    
            <h3>What can users interaction with?</h3>
            <p>
                The user can customize how they want to filter the data by different factors, 
                such as economics, health, or time. Different visualizations or dataset will 
                show up based on the users’ desires. The users can also use forms to search for
                specific data within the dataset which they can use it to provide their own
                research in the future. 
            </p>
    
            <h3>How can this app solve the problem?</h3>
            <p>
                Through these visualizations and datasets, users will gain a better acknowledgment 
                of the correlation between happiness indices and different factors of the country, so that
                they can publish their studies or take actions accordingly.
